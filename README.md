## Overview

This repository contains some low-tech tools designed to help you make Twitter a nicer place for
yourself.

For example, I get a lot of hate-follows, and I generally try to block these users as quickly as
possible. One of the things this project provides is a command-line tool that takes a Twitter screen
name and lists all of the accounts you've blocked that that account follows:

```
$ cargo build --release
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.06s

$ target/release/twcc blocked-follows sfscala
@jdegoes             11807
@rolandkuhn           9238
@propensive           8323
@etorreborre          7045
@ChiefScientist       5450
@dibblego             3587
@nuttycom             3307
@kubukoz              2808
@scalaworldconf       2495
...
```

This makes it much easier to decide which new followers you need to block (it's like a version of
Twitter's "Followed by â€¦ and 123 others you follow" that's actually useful).

The same CLI also provides a way to search the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) for
deleted tweets by a specified user:

```
$ target/release/twcc deleted-tweets --enable-browser --limit 100 jdegoes
https://web.archive.org/web/20190922222236/https://twitter.com/jdegoes/status/1170420726400212997
https://web.archive.org/web/20190923221242/https://twitter.com/jdegoes/status/1170711737361940481
https://web.archive.org/web/20200526150339/https://twitter.com/jdegoes/status/1265251872048320513
```

(In this case we've limited the search to the 100 tweets most recently archived by the Wayback
Machine.)

It can also print a list of everyone you currently block, follow, or are followed by, it can get the
URL of a deleted tweet from the URL of a reply, and it can partition a list of tweet IDs by their
deleted status.

## Setup

You'll need to [install Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

Once you've got those, you can run `cargo build --release` and the binaries will be available in the
`target/release` directory.

For the main `twcc` application, you'll need
[Twitter API access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)
for your Twitter account, and you'll need to provide the necessary keys in a file (by default
`keys.toml`):

```toml
[twitter]
consumerKey="****"
consumerSecret="****"
accessToken="****"
accessTokenSecret="****"
```

Some commands (and other applications) optionally require a
[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)
server instead of (or in addition to) API access. These should work with either
[ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) or
[GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).

## Other

The project also contains some other miscellaneous stuff, including a way to export your Twitter
block list even if you don't have a Twitter API account, and a way to search the Wayback Machine
even if the CDX server isn't working.

It doesn't currently include a few related tools I use regularly, including a way to block everyone
who retweeted or favorited a given tweet, a bunch of stuff related to Wayback Machine ingestion
and downloading, and some scripts that bundle some of the follower functionality into daily reports.

Most of these things are excluded for one of the following reasons:

* They're even more fragile than the stuff that's here now.
* I haven't ported them from Scala to Rust yet.
* They probably technically violate some ToS somewhere.

I might add some of them eventually.
