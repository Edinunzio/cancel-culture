# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and I'd especially appreciate feedback or improvements on my use of Rust,
which is a relatively new language for me. Please note, though, that these are tools that I've
developed for my personal use, and that this project has relatively low priority among open source
projects I maintain. I'll do my best to review pull requests in a timely fashion, but no guarantees.

Participants in any forums related to this project are expected to follow the
[Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). For
escalation or moderation issues please contact Travis Brown (travisrobertbrown@gmail.com)
instead of the Rust moderation team.
